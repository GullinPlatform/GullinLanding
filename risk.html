              <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Welcome to Gullin! We provide a platform to easily participate in token sales.</p>

            <p>Users of Gullin may open an account as a token sale contributor or they may view Content made available to the
              general public.
            </p>

            <p>By using Gullin, including by simply viewing content on the Site, you are agreeing that you, and each person
              you allow to access Gullin through your account, will abide by the terms of this Terms of Service Agreement,
              which is set forth in its entirety below. This agreement is between you and Gullin, LLC and it governs your
              access to and use of the services, websites, and applications offered by Gullin. Your access to and use of
              the services are conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with this agreement.</p>

            <p>The website is not directed to any person in any jurisdiction where (by reason of that person&#39;s nationality,
              residence or otherwise) the publication or availability of the website is prohibited. Persons in respect of
              whom such prohibitions apply must not access the website. For more information, see section XII.a (Availability
              of services).</p>

            <p>Capitalized terms used herein are defined in section XIII (Definitions) of this agreement.</p>

            <p>Significant regulatory considerations apply to the transactions and other activity taking place on the website,
              and this Agreement sets forth terms on which companies interact with token sale contributors through our platform.
            </p>

            <p>COMPANIES: If you are a company, you are welcome to get in contact via email or cell phone with us to share information
              about about your token sale, including information you consider confidential, and to designate which token
              sale contributors may see that information (either by listing specific token sale contributors, or by indicating
              categories of token sale contributors that may see your Locked Information). We will use best efforts to display
              information you have designated as &quot;Locked&quot; only to token sale contributors who have told us that
              they fit within the categories you have identified. We cannot, however, guarantee that token sale contributors
              who see your Locked Information will not distribute that information. We also cannot guarantee that there will
              never be a software bug or a hacker attack that allows unauthorized viewing of Locked Information. Similarly,
              we cannot guarantee that token sale contributors actually fit within the categories they have identified themselves
              under.
            </p>

            <p>TOKEN SALE CONTRIBUTORS: The only individuals who are authorized to create token sale contributor accounts on
              the website are sophisticated individuals with personal or professional experience assessing the long term
              prospects of early stage companies and projects. Token sale contributors must understand the risk of contributing
              in early stage companies, including the high likelihood of loss and long period of illiquidity. In addition,
              if you are using the site as an token sale contributors, you must be sophisticated enough to protect your own
              interests. As a token sale contributors, you may participate in one of the token sales offered through the
              website. In the course of participating in token sale opportunities through the website, you may receive Locked
              Information. You will also select what kinds of companies you would like an introduction to and what kinds
              of token sale information you would like to see. We do not guarantee to show you all token sale details that
              meet your criteria, nor can we guarantee token sale details that we show you will actually satisfy your criteria.</p>

            <p>GENERAL USERS: Certain portions of the Site will be visible to users who have not signed up as either companies
              or token sale contributors. Those users, nevertheless, are bound by this agreement. Companies should be aware
              that information they provide that is not designated as &quot;Locked&quot; will be visible to everybody.</p>

            <p>
              <strong>1. GENERAL SECURITIES PRINCIPLES</strong>
            </p>

            <p>The security laws applicable to private company finance are complicated and occasionally ambiguous. In general,
              they are designed to protect unsophisticated people from making poor investment decisions. Federal securities
              law requires securities sold in the United States to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
              (&quot;SEC&quot;), unless the sale qualifies for an exemption. Generally, startup ventures use one or more
              of the &quot;private placement&quot; exemptions because they allow for the raising of capital without complying
              with the costly and time-consuming registration process. One of the requirements of the private placement exemption
              is that neither the company which is offering its securities nor any person acting on such issuer&#39;s behalf
              may offer or sell the securities by any form of &quot;general solicitation&quot;, except where, as provided
              under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D, the issuer has taken reasonable steps to verify that all of the investors
              in the offering are Accredited Investors. Furthermore, many states and foreign countries all have their own
              regulations governing securities transactions that must be observed. You must make your own assessment regarding
              regulatory requirements as may be applied to your activities on the website.
            </p>

            <p>

              <strong>4. COMPANY SERVICES AND LICENSE</strong>
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>License to Use the Service. All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content provided
                by users) is and will remain the exclusive property of Gullin and its licensors. The Services are protected
                by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Except as expressly
                provided herein, nothing in this Agreement gives you a right to use the Gullin name or any of the Gullin
                trademarks, logos, domain names or other distinctive brand features. Subject to your acceptance of this Agreement,
                Gullin grants to you a worldwide, non-assignable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable limited license
                to use the Services and related software and to display any non-confidential results of such Services anywhere
                on the rest of the web, provided that you:


                <ol>
                  <li>do not use the license to engage in any commercial activity;</li>

                  <li>do not modify the content, except as described below;</li>

                  <li>attribute Gullin with a human and machine-followable link (an anchor tag) linking back to the page displaying
                    the original source of the Content on Gullin;</li>

                  <li>update a particular piece of Content to the latest version on Gullin; and</li>

                  <li>delete Content that has been deleted on Gullin.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>

              <li>No Claim to Any Rights in Your Information. We will not claim any ownership interest in the Content provided
                by you to us solely because you have provided it, although we will claim a license sufficient to display
                such items through Gullin.</li>

              <li>Company will display content and allow communications based on Filters. When you create an account with Gullin,
                and at any time thereafter, you are able to set a variety of filters that are intended to control who can
                see your information and what information you will be shown. We will not intentionally violate those filters,
                although you must recognize that we cannot guarantee that there will never be a software bug or a hacker
                attack that will allow unauthorized viewing of material or unsolicited contacts to occur.</li>

            <p>
              <strong>5. RESERVATION OF THE COMPANY&#39;S RIGHTS</strong>
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Right to Control Content. Gullin may, but is not required to, monitor or control the Content posted via the
                Services. Our failure to exercise this right does not give you any right to make a claim against Gullin.
                Any Content that has been uploaded through the Services may be deleted at any time without notice to you.</li>

              <li>Right to Discontinue the Services. Gullin reserves the right to discontinue the Services or to change the Services
                in any way and at any time, with or without notice to you, without liability.</li>

              <li>Right to Terminate User Access. Gullin reserves the right to terminate your access to the Services without
                notice and, if you violate this Agreement, to pursue other remedies at law or in equity. We may delete your
                account for any reason, and if we delete your account you will lose all access to any information, connections
                or other features that may have been associated with your account.</li>

              <li>Right to Refuse or Cancel Registration. The Company has the right to refuse registration of or cancel your
                user account in its discretion for any reason. In addition, the Company reserves the right at all times (but
                will not have an obligation) to remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services and to terminate
                users and/or reclaim usernames. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information
                as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental
                request, (ii) enforce this Agreement (including investigation of potential violations hereof), (iii) detect,
                prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests or
                (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Gullin, its users and the public.</li>

              <li>User Acknowledgement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you specifically acknowledge that the
                Company is exempt from liability to any person for any claim based upon its termination of an account or
                disabling of access to or removal of any Content, including material it believes, in its sole discretion
                to violate this Agreement, regardless of whether the material ultimately is determined to be infringing or
                otherwise prohibited, and regardless of whether such termination or disabling has the effect of reducing
                the value of any Content or opportunities that might otherwise have been available to you. By using the Services,
                you agree that notice to you through an email to the email address you provided in your profile constitutes
                notification of any removal or disabling if such notice is required.</li>

              <li>Comments, Feedback, Suggestions, Ideas, And Other Submissions. The Services may invite you to chat or participate
                in blogs, message boards, and other functionality and may provide you with the opportunity to create, submit,
                post, transmit, publish or distribute Content to the Company or to/via the Services. Any such material you
                transmit to the Company or otherwise through the Services will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary.
                All comments, feedback, suggestions, ideas, forum posts and other submissions disclosed, submitted or offered
                to the Company in connection with the use of the Services or otherwise, and any chat, blog, message board,
                online forum, text, email or other communication with the Company, shall deemed to have been licensed to
                the Company on a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual basis. For more information, see our Privacy
                Policy.

            <p>We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor and/or manage disputes between you and other users of
              the services. If you have a dispute with other users, you release the company and hereby agree to indemnify
              the company from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and
              unknown, arising out of, or in any way connected with, such a dispute.</p>

              <strong>11. ARBITRATION</strong>
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Informal Negotiations. To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related
                to this agreement (&quot;Dispute&quot;), you and the company agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute
                (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating
                any arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one person to the other. You
                will send your notice to:</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Gullin, LLC</p>

            <p>ATTENTION: LEGAL DEPARTMENT</p>

            <p>215 Bullens Ave Lane</p>

            <p>Woodlyn, PA 19094</p>

            <p>The company will send its notice to your address as set forth in the books and</p>

            <p>records of the company, or if no such address has been provided, by email to the</p>

            <p>email address provided by you in connection with your use of the services.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Binding Arbitration at Option of Either Party. If you and the company are unable to resolve a dispute through
                informal negotiations, either you or the company may elect to have the dispute (except those disputes expressly
                excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by confidential binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate
                by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD
                HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under
                the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and, where appropriate,
                the AAA&#39;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (&quot;AAA Consumer Rules&quot;), both
                of which are available at the
                <a href="http://www.adr.org/">AAA website</a>. The determination of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the
                Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court of proper jurisdiction rather than an arbitrator. Your
                arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where
                appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive,
                the Company will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted, at the option of
                the claimant, either in person or by video conference. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but
                need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable
                law, and any award may be challenged within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 30 days) if the arbitrator
                fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this agreement, you and the company may litigate in court
                to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment
                on the award entered by the arbitrator. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered
                and enforcement obtained thereon in any court having jurisdiction. All arbitration proceedings shall be closed
                to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary
                to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. Each party shall have the right to participate by
                video conference in order to minimize travel and expense burdens. Subject to Section IX of this Agreement
                (Disclaimers; Limitations; Waivers Of Liability), the arbitrator shall have authority to grant any form of
                appropriate relief, whether legal or equitable in nature, including specific performance.
              </li>

              <li>Restrictions/No Class Actions. You and the company agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the dispute
                between the company and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be
                joined with any other; (2) no dispute between you and the company is to be arbitrated on a class-action basis
                or will utilize class action procedures; and (3) you may not bring any dispute in a purported representative
                capacity on behalf of the general public, other users of the Services or any other persons.</li>

              <li>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration. You and the company agree that the following disputes
                are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any
                disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or the company&#39;s intellectual
                property rights; (2) any dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy
                or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.</li>
            </ol>

              <li>Availability of Services.


                <ol>
                  <li>The Company operates and controls the services from its offices in the United States. The company makes
                    no representation that the services are appropriate or available in other locations. The information
                    provided on or through the services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity
                    in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation
                    or which would subject the company to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
                    Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the ervices from other locations do so at their own risk
                    and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
                  </li>

                  <li>Certain information provided by companies or Investors may be subject to U.S. export controls. Thus, no
                    such materials may be downloaded, exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of)
                    Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Syria or any other country to which the United States has embargoed goods;
                    or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department&#39;s Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S.
                    Commerce Department&#39;s Denied Persons List. By downloading any material available through the Services,
                    you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident
                    of, any such country or on any such list. The parties specifically disclaim application of the United
                    Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>

              <li>Injunctive Relief. You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made hereunder to the company are
                of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm the company and which cannot
                be replaced by monetary damages alone, so that the company shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable
                relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory
                breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief and agree to
                limit your claims to claims for monetary damages (if any).</li>

              <li>Amendments to this Agreement. We may amend this agreement at any time in our sole discretion, effective upon
                posting the amended terms of service at the domain of www.gullin.io where the prior version of this agreement
                was posted or by communicating these changes through any written or other contact method we have established
                with you. Your use of the services following the date on which such amended terms are published will constitute
                consent to such amendments. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act
                to modify this agreement.</li>

              <li>Venue and Governing Law. This agreement and all aspects of the services shall be governed by and construed
                in accordance with the internal laws of the United States and the State of Pennsylvania governing contracts
                entered into and to be fully performed in California (i.e., without regard to conflict of law&#39;s provisions)
                regardless of your location except that Section XI (Arbitration) of this agreement shall be governed by the
                Federal Arbitration Act. For the purpose of any judicial proceeding to enforce an arbitration award or incidental
                to such arbitration or to compel arbitration, or if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than
                in arbitration, you hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state and Federal courts sitting
                in Pennsylvania, and agree that service of process in such arbitration or court proceedings shall be satisfactorily
                made upon a party if sent by certified, express or registered mail addressed to it at the address set forth
                in the books and records of the company, or if no such address has been provided, by email to the email address
                provided by the relevant party to the Company in connection with its use of the services. With respect to
                any disputes not subject to informal dispute resolution or arbitration (as set forth above), you agree not
                to commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other than in the state and federal courts located
                in Pennsylvania, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum
                non conveniens with respect to, venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts located in Pennsylvania.
                To the extent non-U.S. laws mandate a different approach with respect to governing law, venue, statute of
                limitation, and dispute resolution method with respect to certain non-U.S. persons, each such required standard
                shall be applied, but all other provisions under this section shall remain in full force.</li>

              <li>Waiver and Severability.


                <ol>
                  <li>The failure of the company to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of this agreement
                    or to exercise any right under this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of
                    the company&#39;s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.
                    In fact, the company may choose to enforce certain portions of this agreement more strictly or to interpret
                    certain provisions more strictly against certain users than it does against users in general, and such
                    disparate treatment shall not be grounds for failing to comply with all this agreement as so interpreted.</li>

                  <li>You and the company agree that if any portion of this agreement, except any portion of section XI.b (Binding
                    Arbitration at Option of Either Party) is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part by any
                    court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
                    extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability
                    thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of this agreement,
                    which shall continue to be in full force and effect. If section XI.b is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
                    then neither you nor the company will elect to arbitrate any dispute falling within that portion of Section
                    XI.b found to be illegal or unenforceable and such dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
                    within Pennsylvania, and you and the company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>

              <li>Section Headings; Verification Documentation; Waiver of Execution Defenses. The section headings used herein
                are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import. Upon the company&#39;s request, you will
                furnish the company any documentation, substantiation or releases necessary to verify your compliance with
                this agreement. You agree that this agreement will not be construed against the company by virtue of having
                drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of this agreement
                and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute this agreement.</li>

              <li>Prohibition of Assignment. You may not assign this agreement without the company&#39;s prior written consent.</li>

              <li>Entire Agreement. This agreement contains the entire understanding of you and the company, and supersedes all
                prior understandings of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof, and cannot be changed or
                modified by you except as posted on the services by the company. No waiver by either party of any breach
                or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.</li>

              <li>Statute of Limitations. You and the company both agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary
                but only to the extent permissible by law in each relevant jurisdiction, any claim or cause of action arising
                out of or related to use of the services, this agreement or our privacy policy must be filed within ONE (1)
                YEAR after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</li>

              <li>No Third Party Beneficiaries. This agreement is between you and the company. No user has any rights to force
                the company to enforce any rights it may have against you or any other user, except to the extent that companies
                may enforce their own intellectual property rights related to content offered through the services.</li>

              <li>Government Use. If you are a part of an agency, department or other entity of the U.S. Government (&quot;Government&quot;),
                the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of any of our products
                or services is restricted in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations as applied to civilian agencies
